    Represents a database cursor, which is used to manage the context of a fetch operation.

    Attributes:
        connection: Database connection object.
        description: Sequence of 7-item sequences describing one result column.
        rowcount: Number of rows produced or affected by the last execute operation.
        arraysize: Number of rows to fetch at a time with fetchmany().

    Methods:
        __init__(connection) -> None.
        callproc(procname, parameters=None) -> Modified copy of the input sequence with output parameters.
        close() -> None.

        executemany(operation, seq_of_parameters) -> None.
        fetchone() -> Single sequence or None if no more data is available.
        fetchmany(size=None) -> Sequence of sequences (e.g. list of tuples).
        fetchall() -> Sequence of sequences (e.g. list of tuples).
